<h2>Notorious</h2>

> Hi, most people call me "Noto". However, you can call me what you want just don't call me late for dinner. I mostly dabble in automation software development, so thats mostly what you can expect to find here. I'm still in the process of learning new things but I have been coding since the 90's. :sunglasses: #hungerneverdies
